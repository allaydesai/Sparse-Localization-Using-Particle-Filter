**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

In this project you will implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. Your particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step your filter will also get observation and control data.

Particle filter invovles using a known map location along with a set of landmarks. The goal is to estimate position based on noisy sensor data and nearby landmarks. Starting location is provided using GPS input. The accuracy of position estimate is improved by updating weights added to each particle. Finally, the particles are resampled based on their respective weights resulting in only probable particles surviving.

**Project Goals**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Build a particle filter for sparse localization
* **Accuracy**: your particle filter should localize vehicle position and yaw to within the values specified in the parameters `max_translation_error` and `max_yaw_error` in `src/main.cpp`.

* **Performance**: your particle filter should complete execution within the time of 100 seconds.

**Project Simulator**

This project involves Tracking Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see [this concept in the classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77) for the required version and installation scripts.

**Project Dependencies**

* cmake: 3.5
* make: 4.1 (Linux and Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
* gcc/g++: 5.4
* uWebSocketIO: Use install-ubuntu.sh

**Project Build Instructions**

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF

**Other Important Dependencies**
* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

# Implementing the Particle Filter

## Interaction with simulator

Here is the main protocol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.

INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

// sense noisy position data from the simulator

["sense_x"]

["sense_y"]

["sense_theta"]

// get the previous velocity and yaw rate to predict the particle's transitioned state

["previous_velocity"]

["previous_yawrate"]

// receive noisy observation data from the simulator, in a respective list of x/y values

["sense_observations_x"]

["sense_observations_y"]


OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

// best particle values used for calculating the error evaluation

["best_particle_x"]

["best_particle_y"]

["best_particle_theta"]

//Optional message data used for debugging particle's sensing and associations

// for respective (x,y) sensed positions ID label

["best_particle_associations"]

// for respective (x,y) sensed positions

["best_particle_sense_x"] <= list of sensed x positions

["best_particle_sense_y"] <= list of sensed y positions


Your job is to build out the methods in `particle_filter.cpp` until the simulator output says:

```
Success! Your particle filter passed!
```

## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory.

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

### All other data the simulator provides, such as observations and controls.

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.

# Result
If your particle filter passes the current grading code in the simulator (you can make sure you have the current version at any time by doing a `git pull`), then you should pass!

The things the grading code is looking for are:
